# Exercise 2

Return USA customers, and for each customer the total number of orders and total quantities.

Tables involved: *Customers*, *Orders* and *OrderDetails* tables

Tip: Since you will use aggregation function *COUNT*, *SUM*, you need to group data by customer id as well. You need to be aware that some records my have duplicates during join. So you need to ditsinct (DISTINCT) them in one of the aggregation function.

Desired output:
```
custid      numorders   totalqty
----------- ----------- -----------
