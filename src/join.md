# Join

In Structured Query Language (SQL), a JOIN is a method of linking two data tables in a single query, allowing the database to return a set that contains data from both tables at once, or using data from one table to be used as a Filter on the second table. There are several types of JOINs defined within the ANSI SQL standard:

* CROSS JOIN
* INNER JOIN
* LEFT JOIN
* RIGHT JOIN

In simple words a SQL Join statement is used to combine data or rows from two or more tables based on a common field between them.
